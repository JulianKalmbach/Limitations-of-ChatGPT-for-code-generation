## University datastructure
Write me a program, where I can store and retrieve data about students of a university

_Certainly! Here's a simple Python program that allows you to store and retrieve data about students at a university. The program uses a dictionary to store information such as the student's name, age, and course:_

```python
class University:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, student_id, name, age, course):
        self.students[student_id] = {'name': name, 'age': age, 'course': course}
        print(f"Student {name} added successfully.")

    def get_student_info(self, student_id):
        if student_id in self.students:
            student_info = self.students[student_id]
            print(f"Student ID: {student_id}")
            print(f"Name: {student_info['name']}")
            print(f"Age: {student_info['age']}")
            print(f"Course: {student_info['course']}")
        else:
            print(f"Student with ID {student_id} not found.")

    def list_all_students(self):
        print("List of all students:")
        for student_id, student_info in self.students.items():
            print(f"Student ID: {student_id}, Name: {student_info['name']}")

# Example usage:
university = University()

university.add_student(101, "John Doe", 20, "Computer Science")
university.add_student(102, "Jane Smith", 22, "Mathematics")

university.list_all_students()

university.get_student_info(101)
university.get_student_info(103)
```

_This program defines a `University` class with methods to add students, retrieve information about a specific student, and list all students. You can customize it further based on your specific needs. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to create a `University` object, add students, list all students, and retrieve information about a specific student._

Could you now write a file write library that can be used to store the data in a fitting file structure?

_Certainly! Below is an example of a simple file write library that you can use to store student data in a file structure. This example uses JSON format for simplicity:_

```python
import json

class UniversityFileManager:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def write_to_file(self, data):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump(data, file, indent=2)
        print(f"Data written to {self.file_path} successfully.")

    def read_from_file(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)
            return data
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"File not found: {self.file_path}")
            return {}

# Example usage:
university_file_manager = UniversityFileManager("university_data.json")

# Example data
data_to_write = {
    'students': {
        101: {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 20, 'course': 'Computer Science'},
        102: {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'age': 22, 'course': 'Mathematics'},
    }
}

# Write data to file
university_file_manager.write_to_file(data_to_write)

# Read data from file
read_data = university_file_manager.read_from_file()
print("\nData read from file:")
print(read_data)
```

_This program defines a `UniversityFileManager` class with methods to write data to a file (`write_to_file`) and read data from a file (`read_from_file`). It uses the `json` module to serialize and deserialize the data in JSON format._

_You can customize the file format or storage method based on your requirements._

Could you now implement that program into the program for the university

_Certainly! I'll integrate the file management functionality into the University program. The program will now write student data to a file after adding or modifying students, and it will read from the file when the program starts to load the existing data. Here's the updated program:_

```python
import json

class UniversityFileManager:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def write_to_file(self, data):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump(data, file, indent=2)
        print(f"Data written to {self.file_path} successfully.")

    def read_from_file(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)
            return data
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"File not found: {self.file_path}")
            return {}

class University:
    def __init__(self, file_manager):
        self.file_manager = file_manager
        self.students = self.file_manager.read_from_file()

    def add_student(self, student_id, name, age, course):
        self.students[student_id] = {'name': name, 'age': age, 'course': course}
        print(f"Student {name} added successfully.")
        self.file_manager.write_to_file(self.students)

    def get_student_info(self, student_id):
        if student_id in self.students:
            student_info = self.students[student_id]
            print(f"Student ID: {student_id}")
            print(f"Name: {student_info['name']}")
            print(f"Age: {student_info['age']}")
            print(f"Course: {student_info['course']}")
        else:
            print(f"Student with ID {student_id} not found.")

    def list_all_students(self):
        print("List of all students:")
        for student_id, student_info in self.students.items():
            print(f"Student ID: {student_id}, Name: {student_info['name']}")

# Example usage:
university_file_manager = UniversityFileManager("university_data.json")
university = University(university_file_manager)

university.add_student(101, "John Doe", 20, "Computer Science")
university.add_student(102, "Jane Smith", 22, "Mathematics")

university.list_all_students()

university.get_student_info(101)
university.get_student_info(103)
```

_This program now initializes the `University` class with a `UniversityFileManager` instance and loads existing student data from the file during initialization. The `add_student` method writes the updated data to the file after adding a student. You can customize the file path and structure based on your needs._
